        "* Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that helps us to estimate unknown population parameters from a sample of data. In other words, it's a way of making educated guesses about characteristics of a whole population based on a smaller sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "###There are two types of estimates in estimation statistics: point estimates and interval estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "* A point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate the value of an unknown population parameter. For example, if we want to estimate the average height of all students in a school, we might take a sample of 50 students and calculate the mean height of that sample. This mean height is a point estimate for the population mean height.\n",
        "\n",
        "* An interval estimate is a range of values that is used to estimate the value of an unknown population parameter. For example, if we want to estimate the average income of all people in a city, we might take a sample of 1000 people and calculate the mean income of that sample. However, we cannot be sure that this sample mean is exactly equal to the population mean. Therefore, we can calculate an interval estimate, such as a confidence interval, which gives us a range of values that is likely to contain the true population mean with a certain level of confidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Interval estimates are generally considered more informative than point estimates because they provide a range of plausible values rather than a single value. Additionally, interval estimates are more reliable than point estimates because they take into account the random variation in the sample data."

It has a similar shape to the standard normal distribution but has heavier tails and a flatter peak. The shape of the t-distribution depends on the sample size and the degrees of freedom (df), which is the number of observations minus one.\n",

        "* In these situations, the t-distribution allows us to calculate a range of values that the population mean is likely to fall within, given the sample mean and the sample size. It also allows us to calculate a t-statistic, which can be used to test the null hypothesis that the population mean is equal to a specific value. By using the t-distribution, we can determine whether the difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized population mean is statistically significant.\n",
